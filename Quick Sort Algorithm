Quick Sort Pseudo-code

Compare the first entry to the last entry.
If the first entry is greater than the last entry, swap them.
Compare the first entry to the middle entry.
If the first entry is greater than the middle entry, swap them.
The middle entry is the pivot.

Swap the pivot with the second to last entry in the list.
Iterate the list from the second entry for the first entry greater than or equal to the pivot.
Assign the left index this entry.
Iterate the list from the third to last entry for the first entry that is less than or equal to the pivot.
Assign the right index this entry.
If the left index is less than the right index, swap the entries.
Repeat iteration of the list until an entry is equal to the pivot.
Swap the left index with the pivot entry.

Partition the array by the pivot.
If the sub array is less than four entries, call insertion sort or shell sort.

Call the quick sort method with the less than sub array, the first entry and the entry before the pivot.
Call the quick sort method with the greater than sub array, the entry after the pivot, and the last entry.
